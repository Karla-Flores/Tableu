<h3>Background</h3>
<p align = 'justify'>Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program in Jersey City has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. A series of dashboards are needed to understand the data and provide the ability to the city officials to make decisions. The following work was made in Tableau to analyze the CityBike data from January - December 2020.
<br>
<h3>Data Source</h3>
The data was downloaded from the City Bike Data website. Information was compiled from January to December 2020 from Jersey City. A loop was made to concatenate the csv files and create a single one containing the report of the 2020 trips used as the basis for this analysis.
